Below we use the following format: `<tag : scope of the commit>`

* fd : finite difference DSL
* api : anything else concerning the API that doesn't belong to `fd`
* compiler : compilation (ie operator, ir, passes, symbolics)
* arch : jit and architecture (basically anything in devito/arch)
* tests : obv
* examples : obv
* builtins : obv
* misc : tools etc
* mpi : MPI related (this might overlap with `compiler`)
* gpu : GPU related (this might overlap with `compiler`)
* sympy : sympy-related patch
* ...
