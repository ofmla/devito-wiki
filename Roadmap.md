## Prioritized tasks 

1. **Performance benchmarks**
<br>Add performance benchmarks to continuous integration. This can include adding an image capturing performance on benchmark problems to the top level.

1. **Free surface boundary condition**
<br>Handle free surface boundary condition by *smartening* stencil behavior at boundary. Currently the free surface BC is handled by copying slices of wavefields per timestep into a mirror array with appropriate polarity reversal. This will is non optimal for performance and free surface modeling is critical to industry scale uptake. 

1. **GPU something something**
<br>Make it go fast

1. **Handle complex arithmetic**
<br>Add capability to handle complex in Devito

1. **Automated roofline model generation in TheMatrix for both CPUs and GPUs**


## Un-prioritized tasks

* **Eikonal solver hackathon**
<br>Use Devito to implement a fast sweeping method TTI anisotropic eikonal solver. This has many valuable use cases including improving illumination compensation (potential improvements for FWI workflows), enabling "expanding box" (potential improvements in throughput especially for large problems), and the ability to generate traveltime tables.

* **mpi ```collect``` function**
<br>A ```Data``` method to collect and return MPI distributed wavefields not requiring MPI calls directly. e.g. ```u.collect()``` 

* **Test sincos** for trig in TTI system
<br>TTI systems often has ```sin(a) cos(a)``` nearby in mathematical expressions. The ```sincos``` function can be vectorized and is worth investigating for performance relative individual ```sin``` and ```cos``` calls.

* **No-copy operators**
Currently Devito's operators assume that they're always working on Devito-allocated memory. We could jump through a few hoops to repackage externally allocated memory as `Function` objects and have Devito operators work (partially) off them. This will:
> - Speed up checkpointing
> - Be useful in doing any kind of data movement, e.g. do the first time step while copying Data into Devito's memory from externally allocated memory
> - e.g. 2, do a timestep while doing CPU->GPU (and reverse) data transfers
> - e.g. 3, do a timestep while doing a data layout transformation, in the simplest case, even a transpose

* **remainder spatial loops**
<br> generated code has 4 calls to spatial loop functions per time step, for handling:
x-interior, y-interior, x-interior, y-remainder, x-remainder, y-interior, x-remainder, y-remainder.
<br>These could be replaced with a single call to the function that used a min or ternary function for the loop traversal.
<br><br>old space loop (with 1 interior and 3 remainder calls):
