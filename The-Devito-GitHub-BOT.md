Things we wish the bot to do:

* For each new PR
  * Check sanity of commit messages and PR titles (tags)
  * Check presence of github tags
  * Report CI turnaround time, raise a warning if too large
  * ...
* Attach codecov to bot account, not Fabio's account (IIRC)
* Attach docs deployment to bot account, not Navjot's account (IIRC)
* ...
